 * A compound job that executes its subjobs one by one in order and finishes
 * when the last subjob finishes. Killing is propagated to subjobs. State
 * information, overall progress and errors are propagated from subjobs.
 *
 * The public API does not allow to add subjobs, so KSequentialCompoundJob is
 * usable only as a base class. addSubjob() is protected because it should be
 * called before start(). A derived class that adds subjobs itself can keep
 * addSubjob() protected. KSimpleSequentialCompoundJob makes addSubjob() public
 * and can be used on its own.
