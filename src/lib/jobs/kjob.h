 * \class KJob
 * \inmodule KCoreAddons
 *
 * The base class for all jobs.
 * For all jobs created in an application, the code looks like
 *
 * \code
 * void SomeClass::methodWithAsynchronousJobCall()
 * {
 *   KJob *job = someoperation(some parameters);
 *   connect(job, &KJob::result, this, &SomeClass::handleResult);
 *   job->start();
 * }
 * \endcode
 *   (other connects, specific to the job)
 *
 * And handleResult is usually at least:
 *
 * \code
 * void SomeClass::handleResult(KJob *job)
 * {
 *   if (job->error()) {
 *       doSomething();
 *   }
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * With the synchronous interface the code looks like
 *
 * \code
 * void SomeClass::methodWithSynchronousJobCall()
 * {
 *   KJob *job = someoperation( some parameters );
 *   if (!job->exec()) {
 *       // An error occurred
 *   } else {
 *       // Do something
 *   }
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * Subclasses must implement start(), which should trigger the execution of
 * the job (although the work should be done asynchronously). errorString()
 * should also be reimplemented by any subclasses that introduce new error
 * codes.
 *
 * \note KJob and its subclasses are meant to be used in a fire-and-forget way.
 * Jobs will delete themselves when they finish using deleteLater() (although
 * this behaviour can be changed), so a job instance will disappear after the
 * next event loop run.
