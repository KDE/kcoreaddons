 * On Windows, this flag is ignored, as the Windows shell has no
 * equivalent functionality.
 * \value AbortOnMeta
 * Put the parser into full shell mode and bail out if a too complex
 * construct is encountered.
 * A particular purpose of this flag is finding out whether the
 * command line being split would be executable directly (via
 * KProcess::setProgram()) or whether it needs to be run through
 * a real shell (via KProcess::setShellCommand()). Note, however,
 * that shell builtins are @em not recognized - you need to do that
 * yourself (compare with a list of known commands or verify that an
 * executable exists for the named command).
 *
 * Meta characters that cause a bail-out are the command separators
 * \c semicolon and \c ampersand, the redirection symbols \c less-than,
 * \c greater-than and the \c pipe \c symbol and the grouping symbols
 * opening and closing \c parentheses.
 *
 * Further meta characters on *NIX are the grouping symbols
 * opening and closing \c braces, the command substitution symbol
 * \c backquote, the generic substitution symbol \c dollar (if
 * not followed by an apostrophe), the wildcards \c asterisk,
 * \c question \c mark and opening and closing \c square \c brackets
 * and the comment symbol \c hash \c mark.
 * Additionally, a variable assignment in the first word is recognized.
 *
 * A further meta character on Windows is the environment variable
 * expansion symbol \c percent. Occurrences of \c \%PERCENT_SIGN% as
 * inserted by quoteArg() are converted back and cause no bail-out,
 * though.

 * Splits \a cmd according to system shell word splitting and quoting rules.
 * Can optionally perform tilde expansion and/or abort if it finds shell
 * meta characters it cannot process.
 *
 * On *NIX the behavior is based on the POSIX shell and bash:
 * - Whitespace splits tokens
 * - The backslash quotes the following character
 * - A string enclosed in single quotes is not split. No shell meta
 *   characters are interpreted.
 * - A string enclosed in double quotes is not split. Within the string,
 *   the backslash quotes shell meta characters - if it is followed
 *   by a "meaningless" character, the backslash is output verbatim.
 * - A string enclosed in $'' is not split. Within the string, the
 *   backslash has a similar meaning to the one in C strings. Consult
 *   the bash manual for more information.
 *
 * On Windows, the behavior is defined by the Microsoft C runtime. Qt and
 * many other implementations comply with this standard, but many do not.
 * - Whitespace splits tokens
 * - A string enclosed in double quotes is not split
 *   - 2N double quotes within a quoted string yield N literal quotes.
 *     This is not documented on MSDN.
 * - Backslashes have special semantics iff they are followed by a double
 *   quote:
 *   - 2N backslashes + double quote => N backslashes and begin/end quoting
 *   - 2N+1 backslashes + double quote => N backslashes + literal quote
 *
 * If AbortOnMeta is used on Windows, this function applies cmd shell
 * semantics before proceeding with word splitting:
 * - Cmd ignores @em all special chars between double quotes.
 *   Note that the quotes are @em not removed at this stage - the
 *   tokenization rules described above still apply.
 * - The \c circumflex is the escape char for everything including
 *   itself.
 *
 * \a cmd the command to split
 *
 * \a flags operation flags, see Option
 *
 * \a err if not NULL, a status code will be stored at the pointer
 *  target, see Errors
 *
 * Returns a list of unquoted words or an empty list if an error occurred
