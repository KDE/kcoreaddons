// =========================================================================
// Description of the cache:
//
// The shared memory cache is designed to be handled as two separate objects,
// all contained in the same global memory segment. First off, there is the
// basic header data, consisting of the global header followed by the
// accounting data necessary to hold items (described in more detail
// momentarily). Following the accounting data is the start of the "page table"
// (essentially just as you'd see it in an Operating Systems text).
//
// The page table contains shared memory split into fixed-size pages, with a
// configurable page size. In the event that the data is too large to fit into
// a single logical page, it will need to occupy consecutive pages of memory.
//
// The accounting data that was referenced earlier is split into two:
//
// 1. index table, containing a fixed-size list of possible cache entries.
// Each index entry is of type IndexTableEntry (below), and holds the various
// accounting data and a pointer to the first page.
//
// 2. page table, which is used to speed up the process of searching for
// free pages of memory. There is one entry for every page in the page table,
// and it contains the index of the one entry in the index table actually
// holding the page (or <0 if the page is free).
//
// The entire segment looks like so:
// ?════════?═════════════?════════════?═══════?═══════?═══════?═══════?═══?
// ? Header │ Index Table │ Page Table ? Pages │       │       │       │...?
// ?════════?═════════════?════════════?═══════?═══════?═══════?═══════?═══?
// =========================================================================

// All elements of this struct must be "plain old data" (POD) types since it
// will be in shared memory.  In addition, no pointers!  To point to something
// you must use relative offsets since the pointer start addresses will be
// different in each process.

// Page table entry
struct PageTableEntry {

    qint32 index;
};

// Each individual page contains the cached data. The first page starts off with
// the utf8-encoded key, a null '\0', and then the data follows immediately
// from the next byte, possibly crossing consecutive page boundaries to hold
// all of the data.
// There is, however, no specific struct for a page, it is simply a location in
// memory.

// This is effectively the layout of the shared memory segment. The variables
// contained within form the header, data contained afterwards is pointed to
// by using special accessor functions.
