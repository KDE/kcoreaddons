/**
 * \class KNetworkMounts knetworkmounts.h <KNetworkMounts>
 *
 * Performance control on network mounts.
 *
 * This class provides methods for deciding whether operations
 * on slow network mounts should be performed or not.
 *
 * Configuration is read from a configuration file network_mounts in
 * the user's QStandardPaths::ConfigLocation. This file can be filled by using
 * the network mounts performance configuration module or directly via @ref setEnabled,
 * @ref setPaths, @ref addPath and @ref setOption
 * @code
 *   KNetworkMounts::self()->setEnabled(true);
 *   KNetworkMounts::self()->setOption(KNetworkMounts::LowSideEffectsOptimizations, true);
 *   KNetworkMounts::self()->addPath(path1, KNetworkMounts::NfsPaths);
 *   KNetworkMounts::self()->addPath(path2, KNetworkMounts::NfsPaths);
 *   KNetworkMounts::self()->setPaths(listOfPaths, KNetworkMounts::SmbPaths);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Use KNetworkMounts like this to check if the given url is on a
 * configured slow path and the KNetworkMountOption LowSideEffectsOptimizations
 * is enabled:
 * @code
 *   if (KNetworkMounts::self()->isOptionEnabledForPath(url.toLocalFile(),
 *       KNetworkMounts::LowSideEffectsOptimizations))
 *   {
 *       // skip operations which are slow on the given url if
 *       // KNetworkMountOption LowSideEffectsOptimizations is enabled
 *   } else {
 *       // given url is not configured being slow or the KNetworkMountOption
 *       // LowSideEffectsOptimizations is not enabled
 *   }
 * @endcode
 *
 * If called for the first time, this creates a singleton instance and reads
 * the config file. Subsequent calls just use this instance without reading
 * the config file again.

     * A symlink path is either a directory which contains symbolic links to slow network mounts

     * SymlinkToNfsOrSmbPaths).
     *
     * Example:
     * There are some Samba shares mounted below /mnt. These are @ref paths of type @ref SmbPaths
     * @code
     * /mnt/server1/share1
     * /mnt/server1/share2
     * /mnt/server2/share3
     * @endcode
     *
     * A (logged in) user may have symbolic links to them in his home directory below netshares. The

     * @code
     * /home/user/netshares/share1 -> /mnt/server1/share1
     * /home/user/netshares/share2 -> /mnt/server1/share2
     * /home/user/netshares/share3 -> /mnt/server2/share3
     * @endcode
     *
     * There is a direct symbolic link from /home/user/share1 to /mnt/server1/share1. This is of type
     * @ref SymlinkToNfsOrSmbPaths:
     * @code
     * /home/user/share1 -> /mnt/server1/share1

     * If the setup is like above a @p path
     * @code
     * /home/user/netshares/share1/Documents/file.txt
     * @endcode
     *
     * would be resolved to
     * @code
     * /mnt/server1/share1/Documents/file.txt

     *
     * would also be resolved to
     * @code
     * /mnt/server1/share1/Documents/file.txt
     * @endcode
     *
     * Resolved paths are cached in a hash.
     *
